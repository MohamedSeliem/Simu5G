# What's New in Simu5G

## v1.4.1 (2025-10-06)

This is a minor update that brings further refactoring of the C++ code for clarity,
improvements in the C++ interface of the Binder module, and some minor bug fixes.
These improvements were contributed by Andras Varga (OMNeT++ Core Team).

Notable changes:

- Binder: Partial rationalization of the C++ interface, via
  renaming/replacing/removing methods. See the git history for changes.

- Updated IP addresses in the IPv4 configuration files: use 10.x.x.x
  addresses for the Core Network, and 192.168.x.x addresses for external
  addresses

- Visual improvement: node IDs are now displayed over module icons

- In MEC, do not use module IDs for bgAppId, deviceAppId and other IDs, and do
  not encode module ID into module names. That practice made simulations brittle
  for regression testing via fingerprints.

- PDCP: Eliminated tweaking of srcId/destId in FlowControlInfo when sending
  downlink packets over the X2 link in a Dual-Connectivity setup.

- Various additional fixes and changes to improve code quality.


## v1.4.0 (2025-09-18)

Compatible with **OMNeT++ 6.2.0** and **INET 4.5.4**.

This release marks an important milestone in the ongoing transformation of
Simu5G. While not introducing behavioral changes, this intermediate release
focuses on restructuring the codebase to improve clarity, safety, and
maintainability. Major updates include a reorganized directory structure,
enforcing a consistent naming convention, making make packets more easily
inspectable, and refactoring of parts of the C++ code to pave the way for
changes in future versions. Although the release is not source-compatible with
previous versions, existing simulations will continue to work unchanged once
adjusted to follow the various rename operations. These improvements were
contributed by Andras Varga (OMNeT++ Core Team).

Renames:

- Sources are now under src/simu5g/ instead of just src/, so that C++ includes
  start with "simu5g/". This helps identifying Simu5G includes when Simu5G is
  used as a dependency of other projects.

- Some folders were moved inside the source tree to a more logical location. For
  example, the simu5g/nodes/mec/ subtree was promoted to simu5g/mec/.

- Several source folders were renamed to more closely follow the all-lowercase
  convention. For example, mec/UALCMP/ became mec/ualcmp/, and mec/MECPlatform
  became just mec/platform.

- Several classes were renamed to ensure that only the first letters of acronyms
  are uppercase. For example, MECHost became MecHost.

- Several parameters were renamed to enforce camelcase names. For example,
  bs_noise_figure became bsNoiseFigure, and fading_paths became numFadingPaths.
  If you have existing Simu5G simulations, review the ini files carefully and
  update the parameter assignments accordingly. (Caveat: Assignment lines that
  refer to the old names will be simply ignored by the simulation -- there is no
  error message for that!)

- The PdcpRrc modules were renamed to just Pdcp. Likewise, pdcpRrc submodules
  in NIC compound modules became pdcp.

Further refactoring:

- Several protocol header classes, while defined in msg files, contained heavy
  customization in C++ code, including the addition of new fields. Since the
  writing of those classes, the message compiler in OMNeT++ gained enough
  features so that most of the customizations were no longer needed, and the
  desired effect could be achieved in msg files only. This refactoring has the
  benefit of making packets more inspectable from Qtenv, and packet contents can
  now be serialized using parsimPack (useful for more thorough fingerprint
  tests).

- MacCid is a central data type that pairs an LCID with a nodeId to uniquely
  identify a logical channel. It used to be a packed integer, and now it was
  turned into a C++ class with separate fields for the node ID and LCID and with
  accessor methods, for increased type safety.

- carrierFrequency used to be a variable of the type double throughout the
  codebase. The type was changed to GHz (using INET's units.h) for increased
  type safety. This also helped identifying a bug in certain channel models
  (LteRealisticChannelModel, BackgroundCellChannelModel) where a double
  representing GHz instead of Hz was used in computing path loss, resulting
  in underestimated path loss values.

- Binder received several WATCHes for increased transparency in Qtenv, and
  an overhaul of a subset of its API and internal data structures.

- In the Pdcp modules, the unused EUTRAN_RRC_Sap port (and associated handling
  code) was removed.

- Refactoring of internals in several protocol modules, including MAC, PDCP and
  RLC implementations.

Build:

- Made the command line build consistent with the IDE build. src/Makefile is now
  generated/updated implicitly on every build, no need to type "make makefiles".

## v1.3.1 (2025-09-18)

This is a minor update for Simu5G-1.3.0. In addition to fixing regressions
in the previous release and making some cosmetic improvements, the main highlight
of this release is the revamp of the fingerprint test suite, which now provides
a more comprehensive safety net against future regressions. Changes in this
release were contributed by Andras Varga (OMNeT++ Core Team).

Changes:
- Example simulations: Marked abstract configs as such (abstract=true) in omnetpp.ini files
- FlowControlInfo's MacNodeId fields are now properly shown in Qtenv object inspectors
- Replaced EV_ERROR << lines with throwing cRuntimeError
- TrafficLightController: fixed startState NED parameter (also changed type from int to string)
- Fingerprints: CSV files merged into simulations.csv, added missing simulations,
  standardized on the set of fingerprints computed (tplx, ~tNl, sz), translated
  gen_runallexamples.py into Python and improved it

Fix regressions in v1.3.0:
- MECResponseApp: fixed wrong @class annotation
- BackgroundScheduler: fix "binder_ not initialized" error
- MecRequestForegroundApp, MecRequestBackgroundGeneratorApp: add back lost parameter defaults
- BackgroundCellTrafficManager: fix "Not implemented" thrown from getBackloggedUeBytesPerBlock()
- tutorials/nr/omnetpp.ini: fix missing unit for txPower parameter (dBm)

## v1.3.0 (2025-02-06)

- Compatible with **OMNeT++ 6.1.0** and **INET 4.5.4**
- New modules: MultiUEMECApp, MecRnisTestApp, UeRnisTestApp
- Added NED documentation for modules
- Increased reusability of modules via changes such as replacing hardcoded module
  paths in the C++ code with NED parameters (binderModule, macModule, etc.), and
  elimination of ancestorPar() calls by introducing local parameters instead. *
- Other NED adjustments, such as removal of unused NED parameters and splitting
  NED files to have one module per file. See doc/NED-changes.txt for details. *
- Extensive C++ modernization, and adaption of more OMNeT++ best practices. *
- Various bug fixes.
- Changes marked with an asterisk were contributed by Andras Varga (OMNeT++ Core
  Team).
